challenge #4 on creating a quiz 

## Description 
Created an HTML quiz where you can test your knowledge in HTML. These questions might be simple but for some might be hard. Coders that are learning such as myslef love to learn slowly but of course there are some that love to learn at a higher intense pace than the average human. Creating this page will allow the user to answer 6 questions but there is a kick to it. if the user gets a question wrong then the users time will decrease and if user doesn't answer fast enough either the user will also run out of time to then display their score. the data will be set to be saved even when refreshed.

## improvements
Creating this page I went through several challenges on creating the JavaScript part to work and function with my code. I have noticed that currently while working on my code that i keep getting an error in my javascript indicating that the displayed element i have chosen in null and still marking other errors in my code to work. I spent too much time trying to debug and also styling my page that the page still needs to be responsive and work like a small game. I am going to turn in what I have and let the personnal who are grading my page give me feed back and also finish it late and re-submit that challenge.

I also got information from the UCSD folders getting codes to reference off of.
